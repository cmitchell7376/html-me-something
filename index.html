                  <h2>My Journey</h2>

                  <h3>High School</h3>
                    <p>The path to sucess differ from person to person, and my path have definitely been unqiue. 
                        Kids dreams of becoming a star athlete, famous movie actor, or a big time Musician. I was
                        one of those kids. Making it to the NFL was my only dream and that dream that i worked 
                        hard for was crushed in one second. Suffing an knee injury that weakened me my entire
                        senior season.</p>

                  <h3>Choosing the college path</h3>
                  <p>After Graduation high school i decided to attend St.Louis Community College as an Graphic
                        Designer. I didnt give up on my dream to make it to the nfl but i needed to attend an affordable 
                        school. Two years later i stop attending St.louis Community College becuase graphic design was 
                        not my calling. At this time in my life all i wanted to do was play football. Even though i was two
                        years removed from the sport i stayed in shape waiting for my opportunity to join a college team.
                        My parents adviced me to stay on the educational path. So i attended Devry university hoping to get
                        into game devlopment. That plan failed as well. From here i made many decision that resulted in failure,
                        Joining a simi-pro football leauge, trying to attend Evangel University to play football, attending Southern
                        Illinois of Edwardsville just to go back to St.louis Community College for a year. After all the back and fourth
                        i finally slowed down and decided to stay at SIUE and graduate as a Computer programmer. Unfortunately 
                        that didnt happen as well.</p>

                  <h3>Hope</h3>
                  <p>Forced with having to drop out of college to deal with personal issues i had to find a different path to become 
                        sucess. I knew that programming was my new passion after taking two coding class at SIUE but i didnt know 
                        how to pursue that dream. Having to deal with financial issues, stress, failure, and now stuck at a job i 
                        didnt love i felt lost. Until my older sister told me about a program named launchcode. Where they 
                        teach you the skills needed to get a entry level job in coding. I am now participanting in this program 
                        with new found hope that i can reach my dream to become a software devloper.</p>
