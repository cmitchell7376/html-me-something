                    Kids dreams of becoming a star athlete, famous movie actor, or a big time Musician. I was
                    one of those kids. Making it to the NFL was my only dream and that dream that i worked 
                    hard for was crushed in one second. Suffing an knee injury that weakened me my entire
                    senior season

                    <p class="text">After Graduation high school i decided to attend St.Louis Community College as an Graphic
                            Designer. I didnt give up on my dream to make it to the nfl but i needed to attend an affordable 
                            school. Two years later i stop attending St.louis Community College becuase graphic design was 
                            not my calling. At this time in my life all i wanted to do was play football. Even though i was two
                            years removed from the sport i stayed in shape waiting for my opportunity to join a college team.
                            My parents adviced me to stay on the educational path. So i attended Devry university hoping to get
                            into game devlopment. That plan failed as well. From here i made many decision that resulted in failure,
                            Joining a simi-pro football leauge, trying to attend Evangel University to play football, attending Southern
                            Illinois of Edwardsville just to go back to St.louis Community College for a year. After all the back and fourth
                            i finally slowed down and decided to stay at SIUE and graduate as a Computer programmer. Unfortunately 
                            that didnt happen as well.

                        <p class="text">Forced with having to drop out of college to deal with personal issues i had to find a different path to become 
                            sucess. I knew that programming was my new passion after taking two coding class at SIUE but i didnt know 
                            how to pursue that dream. Having to deal with financial issues, stress, failure, and now stuck at a job i 
                            didnt love i felt lost. Until my older sister told me about a program named launchcode. Where they 
                            teach you the skills needed to get a entry level job in coding. I am now participanting in this program 
                            with new found hope that i can reach my dream to become a software devloper.
